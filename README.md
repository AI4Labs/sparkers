## **AI Fellowship Program Design and Validation Process**

The **AI Fellowship Program** is designed to develop the core competencies in small teams (5 members per team) over **12 weeks**. Throughout this program, each team will be responsible for building a working AI product while collaborating across the following competency domains: **Core Technology and Product Development**, **Data and Analytics**, and **Innovation and Product Design**. At the end of the program, one team will successfully graduate and be positioned as a **fellowship program** for scaling their AI-powered solutions into a viable business.

The **12-week program** will be divided into stages to ensure that teams not only build technical solutions but also develop **leadership**, **collaboration**, **critical thinking**, and **business acumen** needed to build **AI-driven products**.
